The project takes a set of input photos (in JPEG format) from a specified folder (input_photo_folder). It then processes these photos to generate collage sheets that combine multiple images in a grid format.

Features

- **Collage Generation:** Utilizes the PIL (Python Imaging Library) to create harmonious and aesthetically pleasing collage sheets.
- **Customizable Layout:** Easily tailor sheet size, photo size, and grid parameters to suit your preferences.
- **Batch Processing:** The `convert_photos_to_sheets` function automates the process, generating collage sheets for multiple images in a specified input folder.
- **Output Folder Creation:** Ensures a clean organization by creating the output folder if it doesn't exist.

## Usage

1. **Installation:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install the required PIL library using: `pip install pillow`.

2. **Run the Project:**
   - Modify the `input_photo_folder` and `output_sheet_folder` variables in the example usage section of the script to point to your photo collection and desired output location.
   - Execute the script to generate collage sheets: `python your_script_name.py`.

3. **Customization:**
   - Adjust sheet size, photo size, rows, columns, and margins as needed in the `create_photo_sheet` function.

Example

```python
input_photo_folder = '/path/to/your/photo/folder'
output_sheet_folder = '/path/to/your/output/folder'

convert_photos_to_sheets(input_photo_folder, output_sheet_folder)
```

Future Scope

The Photographic Ensemble Composer is a dynamic project with the following future scope possibilities:

 1. **User Interface (UI) Integration:**
   Incorporate a user-friendly GUI for a more intuitive and interactive experience.

 2. **Image Filtering and Effects:**
   Add options for applying filters and effects to enhance individual photos or the entire collage.

 3. **Automatic Layout Optimization:**
   Implement an algorithm for intelligent photo arrangement based on content or user-defined preferences.

 4. **Template System:**
   Develop a template system for predefined layouts or user-created templates.

 5. **Support for Additional Image Formats:**
   Extend compatibility to support various image formats beyond JPEG.
